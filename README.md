My program automates the generation of performance reports for our sales team, eliminating the need for a time-consuming manual process. Initially, it focused on displaying agent names and their total revenue from one CSV file. However, based on feedback, I expanded its functionality to include data from two CSV files, merging them into a single table. This enhancement allowed me to incorporate additional metrics, such as the number of sales made by each agent, which is crucial for calculating bonuses.

Using Pandas in Google Colab, I efficiently processed and manipulated the data, leveraging my skills in data analysis to streamline the reporting process. Despite encountering challenges like hiding indexes and adding colors for better presentation, I successfully overcame them, achieving a satisfactory outcome.

The impact of the program is significantâ€”it drastically reduces report generation time, transforming a manual process that required considerable effort into a seamless automated solution that can generate reports in less than a minute. This not only improves efficiency but also facilitates better communication within the team, as reports can now be easily shared in our Google Chat group.
